These are the principles on which my setup will be built
1: All programs must do one thing and do it well.
2: All programs must be integrated, both their config and their use.
3: Nothing unnecessary must be installed, everything must have purpose.
4: Everything must be customized to fit a standard:
   - mnemonic key binds, like <space> [f]ile [f]ind.
   - the theme must be consistent.
5: Everything must be reliable, no fixing after installing and configuring.
6: Everything must be minimal and fast.

The following programs are necessary for my work:
 - Text editor           : NeoVim, maybe consider vis
 - Terminal              : st, "it just werks"
 - Window manager        : dwm, maybe 2bwm or some other dwm-like thing.
 - System status display : dwm, or polybar.
 - Program launcher      : dmenu, or dmenu2
 - Shell                 : bash, or rc/dash/mksh
 - Color scheme          : solarized, pretty much settled on it.
 - Audio player          : cmus, pretty good
 - Video player          : mpv, werks
 - System info           : ufetch, werks
 - Office suite          : libreoffice, god that thing is shit.
 - File browser          : ranger, werks
 - Email client          : neomutt, i should really set it up.
 - Browser               : chromium, werks
 - PDF reader            : zathura+mupdf, werks
 - Calender              : calcurses, not set up.
 - Several other trivialities, like unzipping tools etc.
