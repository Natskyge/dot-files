These are the principles on which my OS will be built
1: All programs must do one thing and do it well.
2: All programs must be integrated, both their config and their use.
3: Nothing unnecessary must be installed, everything must have purpose.
4: Everything must be customized to fit a standard:
   - mnemonic key binds, like <space> [f]ile [f]ind.
   - the theme must be consistent.
5: Everything must be reliable, no fixing after installing and configuring.
6: Everything must be minimal and fast.

The following programs are necessary for my work:
 - Text editor
 - Terminal
 - Window manager
 - System status display
 - Program launcher
 - Shell 
 - Color scheme
 - Audio player
 - Video player 
 - System info
 - Office suite
 - File browser
 - Email client
 - Browser
 - PDF reader
 - Calender
 - Several other trivialities, like unzipping tools etc.
